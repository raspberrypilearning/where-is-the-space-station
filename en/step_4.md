## Show the Craft

--- challenge ---


As well as the name of the astronaut the web service also provides the craft that they are in (such as the ISS.)

Can you add to your script so that it also prints out the craft that the astronaut is in? 

Example:

```
People in Space:  3
Yuri Malenchenko in ISS
Timothy Kopra in ISS
Timothy Peake in ISS
```

You need to add code to the print statement in `for p in people:`. Remember you can print multiple items by separating them with commas.

You get the value for the name using `p[name]`, how can you get the value for the `craft`? 
--- /hint --- 
--- hint ---
Change your `for` loop so it looks like this:
```python
for p in people:
  print(p['name'], ' in ', p['craft'])
```
